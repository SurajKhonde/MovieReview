## 📖 About This Project

Hey! 👋 Welcome to the **Movie Review** project.

This started as a **simple movie review platform**, where users could browse and post reviews. The core idea was to build something straightforward — and now we are taking it further by optimizing it for performance, scalability, and production-level standards.

### 🛠️ What We've Built So Far

- **Frontend** built using **React** via Create React App (CRA)
- **Backend** powered by **Node.js** and **Express.js**
- **JWT Authentication** implemented for secure API access
- **HTTPS handling** and **file upload (video upload)**
- Careful handling of **video uploads**, which are often lengthy and error-prone — we ensure smooth and reliable uploading
- Minimum use of external libraries to **keep file size low** and the project lightweight

### 🚀 What We're Improving

We’re actively working on improving the project with features that make it feel **fast**, **secure**, and **real-world ready**:

- 🔄 **Redis Caching**: Speeds up repeated API responses
- 🔍 **Debounced Search**: Reduces unnecessary API calls as the user types
- 🚫 **API Rate Limiting** *(Coming Soon)*: Prevents abuse and overuse of endpoints
- 📦 Optimized architecture for better performance and scalability
