## 💬 Feature: Real-Time Chat with WebSockets (Fan Club)

---

### 💡 Is your feature request related to a problem?

Yes. Our current platform lacks real-time communication, which limits interaction among fans. A static comment system or page reloads break the flow of conversation.

This makes it hard for fan club members to engage with each other live during events or discussions.

---

### ✅ Describe the solution you'd like

We want to introduce a **WebSocket-based real-time chat feature** (like a live chat room) for users in the fan club section.

Key ideas:
- Real-time messaging (using WebSocket or Socket.IO)
- “User is typing...” indicator
- Chat rooms by movie/genre/topic
- Future plans: emoji support, message reactions, moderation tools

**Technology stack:**
- Node.js (Backend)
- WebSocket (e.g., Socket.IO)
- React with TypeScript (Frontend)
- Scalable and modular architecture

---

### 🔄 Describe alternatives you’ve considered

- HTTP long-polling or AJAX: more server strain, worse UX
- Discord embeds: takes users off-platform

WebSockets are the best fit for performance and engagement.

---

### 📎 Additional context

This aligns with our goal of making the fan club more interactive.

Key considerations:
- Authenticated WebSocket connections
- Frontend state management for message flow
- Graceful error handling & disconnections
- TypeScript for strict typing and maintainability
