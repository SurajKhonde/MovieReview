# ðŸ’¡ Feature: Real-Time Chat with WebSockets (Fan Club)

## ðŸ’¡ Is your feature request related to a problem?

Yes. Our current platform lacks real-time communication, which limits interaction among fans. A static comment system or page reloads break the flow of conversation.

This makes it hard for fan club members to engage with each other live during events or discussions.

---

## âœ… Describe the solution you'd like

We want to introduce a **WebSocket-based real-time chat feature** (like a live chat room) for users in the fan club section.

- Enable real-time text communication
- Show when users are typing ("user is typing..." indicators)
- Optionally support rooms (e.g., per movie, actor, genre)
- Future scope: emoji reactions, moderation tools

This feature should be built with:
- **Node.js + WebSocket server (e.g., Socket.IO)**
- **React frontend with TypeScript**
- **Modular and scalable code structure**

---

## ðŸ”„ Describe alternatives youâ€™ve considered

- Using HTTP long-polling or AJAX (but this adds more server strain and poor UX)
- Using 3rd-party chat embeds like Discord, but that takes users off-platform

WebSockets are best for performance, UX, and long-term maintainability.

---

## ðŸ“Ž Additional context

This feature aligns with our goal of making the platform more engaging and interactive for movie fans.

We'll need to handle:
- WebSocket server setup
- Authenticated connections
- Frontend chat UI with state management
- Error handling and graceful disconnection

We plan to build this using **TypeScript** on both client and server sides for type safety and maintainability.
